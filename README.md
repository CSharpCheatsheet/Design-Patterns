[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

The 23 [Gang of Four (GoF)](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|[Creational Patterns](https://github.com/tigranv/Design_Patterns/tree/master/Creational%20Patterns)  |  |
| ----------| ---------------------------------- |
| [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/tigranv/Design-Patterns/tree/master/Creational%20Patterns/Abstract%20Factory) |Creates an instance of several families of classes  | 
|[Builder]() |Separates object construction from its representation  | 
|[Factory Method]() |	Creates an instance of several derived classes  | 
| [Prototype]() |A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned  | 
| [Singleton]() |	A class of which only a single instance can exist  | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


|[Structural Patterns](https://github.com/tigranv/Design_Patterns/tree/master/Structural%20Patterns)  |  |
| ----------| ---------------------------------- |
|  [Adapter]() |Match interfaces of different classes | 
| [Bridge]() |Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation | 
|[Composite]() |A tree structure of simple and composite objects | 
| [Decorator]() |Add responsibilities to objects dynamically | 
|[Facade]() |A single class that represents an entire subsystem | 
|[Flyweight]() |A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing | 
|[Proxy]() |An object representing another object | 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	
 	
|[Behavioral Patterns](https://github.com/tigranv/Design_Patterns/tree/master/Behavioral%20Patterns) |  |
| ----------| ---------------------------------- |
|Chain of Resp|	A way of passing a request between a chain of objects|
|Command|	Encapsulate a command request as an object|
|Interpreter|	A way to include language elements in a program|
|Iterator|	Sequentially access the elements of a collection|
|Mediator|	Defines simplified communication between classes|
|Memento|	Capture and restore an object's internal state|
|Observer|	A way of notifying change to a number of classes|
|State|	Alter an object's behavior when its state changes|
|Strategy|	Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class|
|Template Method|	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass|
|Visitor|	Defines a new operation to a class without change|
